# TrueAudio Next (TAN) SDK

AMD TrueAudio Next is a software development kit for GPU accelerated and multi-core audio signal processing. TrueAudio Next provides pre-optimized library functions for computationally expensive algorithms such as time-varying audio convolution, FFT/FHT, and audio-oriented vector math. Sample applications and examples are included to facilitate integration into audio applications. The SDK also provides GPU utilities functions that support AMD GPU Resource Reservation, a technology that allows audio to share resources on the GPU with graphics while minimizing impact to quality-of-service.
